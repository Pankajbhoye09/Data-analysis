This notebook performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing information about house sales. The dataset, read from a CSV file, includes various features such as price, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and square footage, along with geographic and temporal data.

Library Import: Essential libraries for data manipulation and visualization are imported, including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and the mpl_toolkits for advanced plotting. The %matplotlib inline command ensures that plots are displayed directly within the notebook.

Data Loading: The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame from the CSV file named "kc_house_data.csv".

Initial Data Examination: The first few rows of the dataset are displayed to understand its structure and the type of data it contains. This initial inspection provides a snapshot of key variables such as house prices, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, and additional attributes related to house features and location.

Descriptive Statistics: Summary statistics for the dataset are computed and displayed. This includes measures of central tendency (mean, median) and variability (standard deviation, min, max) for all numerical features, giving insights into the distribution and range of house attributes.
